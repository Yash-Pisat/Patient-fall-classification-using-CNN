## a. Assignment:

Falls by patients are a major source of danger.
Falls often take place near the care bed, for example due to circulatory fluctuations after getting up.
Immediate detection of falls allows caregivers to react quickly, reducing short-term suffering and long-term health effects.
The aim of the project is therefore to develop a cost-effective and efficient means of detecting falls.
This system is intended to quickly detect falls and notify the nursing staff.
At the same time, it should be data-efficient and thus, for example, manage without the use of portable sensors or video surveillance.
The developed system is integrated into care beds.
It absorbs mechanical vibrations that are transmitted through the bed frame.
This requires both sensitive electronics and a way of separating vibration patterns from falls from other patterns as clearly as possible.
To solve this challenge, well-designed experiments will identify meaningful data samples that will be used to train modern AI models for fall detection.
We implement an innovative AI-based approach to detect and classify falls from beds.
The AI architecture of the system processes real-time data from sensors in a complex, varying environment.
A basic ML/AI solution (Deep Learning, Machine Learning) for classification and fall detection will be available.
Using the tools that were taught in the ML/AI lectures, your goal is to analyze, test and optimize (tune) the existing AI solution.

The project involves the following steps:
* The participants get to know the existing (basic) deep-learning AI solution.
This also involves understanding of the application, related events, data
structure, and relevant input parameters of the AI.
* The existing, simple AI architecture should be analyzed and optimized
(tuned). The AI should be able to handle different behavior patterns.
* Results will be evaluated in the real-world setting.
